# Discovery Brief

Commit: fed3b88

## Problem & Goals
- **Primary Problem**: User onboarding process is taking too long (avg. 45 minutes) and has a 25% drop-off rate
- **Goal 1**: Reduce onboarding time by 60% (target: 18 minutes or less)
- **Goal 2**: Improve completion rate to 90% (from current 75%)
- **Goal 3**: Implement automated verification system to reduce manual reviews by 80%

## Non-goals
- Complete redesign of the entire user interface
- Migration to new technology stack
- Integration with third-party identity providers
- Mobile app development

## Stakeholders
- **Product Manager**: Jane Smith (jane.smith@company.com)
- **Engineering Lead**: Mike Johnson (mike.johnson@company.com)
- **UX Designer**: Sarah Wilson (sarah.wilson@company.com)
- **Security Officer**: David Chen (david.chen@company.com)
- **DevOps**: Alex Rodriguez (alex.rodriguez@company.com)

## KPIs (baseline → target; measurement source)
- **Onboarding Time**: 45min → 18min (Google Analytics + custom tracking)
- **Completion Rate**: 75% → 90% (conversion funnel analytics)
- **Manual Review Volume**: 500/day → 100/day (internal dashboard)
- **User Satisfaction**: 3.2/5 → 4.5/5 (post-onboarding survey)

## Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Web application onboarding flow, email verification, document upload
- **Out of Scope**: Mobile apps, API integrations, admin dashboard
- **Dependencies**: User authentication system, file storage service
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks development, 2 weeks testing

## Environments & Constraints
- dev/staging/prod; protected main; background agents auto-branch
- Secret manager; TLS; feature flags
- **Technology Stack**: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2 Type II, data encryption at rest
- **Performance**: < 2s page load time, < 5s verification process
- **Scalability**: Support 10k concurrent users

## Assumptions to Validate
- Users have stable internet connection during onboarding
- Most users will complete onboarding on desktop devices
- Email delivery success rate is > 95%
- File upload size won't exceed 10MB per user
- Third-party verification services are reliable

## Open Questions
- What are the most common points of failure in current onboarding?
- Do we have sufficient user behavior analytics?
- Are there existing patterns we can reuse from other features?
- What training is needed for manual reviewers?
- How do we handle edge cases like international users?
