### Title
Observability Plan: Metrics, Traces, Logs with Gates

### Goal(s)
- Define observability budgets and artifacts across capabilities and domains.

### Why this route + Confidence
- Why: Gates need telemetry to enforce performance, reliability, and correctness.
- Confidence: 0.80.

### Assumptions
1) Centralized telemetry stack (metrics, tracing, logging) exists or is planned.

### Plan
- Metrics: SLOs (availability, latency, error rate); dashboards per domain.
- Traces: instrument critical paths; propagate correlation IDs.
- Logs: structured, PII-redacted; audit trail for sensitive events.

### Trigger → Rule(s) → Outputs → Gates

| Trigger | Rule(s) | Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| observe.metrics | (project-rules placeholder/optional) | Dashboards, SLOs | SLO checks |
| observe.traces | (project-rules placeholder/optional) | Trace configs | Latency budgets |
| observe.logs | (project-rules placeholder/optional) | Log schemas | PII redaction checks |
| docs.sync | `5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines.mdc` | Updated docs | Docs checks |

### Alternatives
- Local-only logging: insufficient for distributed systems.

### Risks and mitigations
- Telemetry cost (Med × Low): sampling, retention policies.

### Dependencies
- Telemetry backend; SDKs; correlation ID standard.

### Success Metrics
- SLO coverage ≥ 90%; alert fatigue reduced; actionable traces on P0 flows.

### Next Steps
- Define per-domain SLOs; integrate with `milestones.md` acceptance criteria.
