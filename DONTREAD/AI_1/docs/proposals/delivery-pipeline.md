### Title
End-to-End Delivery Pipeline (Docs-Only Session)

- Deliverable path: `/workspace/DONTREAD/AI_1/docs/proposals/delivery-pipeline.md`

### Goal(s)
- Define a capability-aligned CI/CD pipeline with explicit quality and security gates.
- Ensure explainable, auditable stages for any project type (web, mobile, backend/API, data/ML, CLI/desktop, infra).

### Assumptions
1. This session is documentation-only; no code changes or deployments.
2. CI runners and artifact storage exist or can be provisioned later.
3. Security overlay is always-on (F8) and blocks on criticals.

### Alternatives
- Monolithic, single-job pipeline (fast but low signal). Rejected: weak gates.
- Fully bespoke per-domain pipelines. Rejected: fragmentation risk; keep common backbone + domain branches.

### Risks (likelihood × impact) and mitigations
- Inconsistent gates across domains (M×M): Standardize MUST gates, allow domain add-ons.
- Slow feedback (M×M): Parallelize static checks and unit tests; cache deps.
- False positives in scans (M×L): Triage rules; severity thresholds; allow safe suppressions with audit trail.

### Dependencies
- `.cursor/rules/master-rules/*`, `.cursor/rules/common-rules/*`.
- Dev workflow docs in `/workspace/.cursor/dev-workflow/*`.

### Pipeline Stages (overview)
1. Source intake → Context discovery → Security overlay preflight.
2. Build (domain-specific) → SBOM generation.
3. Static checks: lint, type, SAST, IaC scan.
4. Tests: unit → integration → e2e/contract.
5. Package and sign artifacts; provenance.
6. Deploy to staging with canary + observability guardrails.
7. Manual/automated promotion to prod with rollback plan.

### Trigger → Rule(s) → File(s)/Outputs → Gates
| Trigger/Capability | Rule(s) [MUST/GUIDELINE] | Files/Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| context.load | [MUST] `.cursor/rules/master-rules/1-master-rule-context-discovery.mdc` | Loaded READMEs, rule set | — |
| security.overlay | [MUST] `.cursor/rules/master-rules/F8-security-and-compliance-overlay.mdc` | `[SECURITY CHECK]` notes | Block on criticals |
| code.quality | [MUST] `.cursor/rules/master-rules/3-master-rule-code-quality-checklist.mdc` | Lint/type configs | CI quality pass |
| code.modify.safety | [MUST] `.cursor/rules/master-rules/4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol.mdc` | Change-safety checklist | Required for merges |
| docs.sync | [MUST] `.cursor/rules/master-rules/5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines.mdc` | Updated docs | Docs lint |
| audit.run | [MUST] `.cursor/rules/master-rules/8-auditor-validator-protocol.mdc` | `reports/audit-*.md` | Audit gate |
| validation.run | [MUST] same as above | `reports/validation-*.md` | Validation gate |
| ui.foundation | [GUIDELINE] `.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-foundation-design-system.mdc` | tokens/grids | AA contrast |
| ui.interaction | [GUIDELINE] `.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc` | ARIA/perf notes | INP/LCP budgets |

### Success Metrics
- <15 min mean PR feedback; ≥80% parallelized checks; 100% SBOM coverage.
- 0 critical, 0 high vulns at release gate; rollback tested quarterly.

### Next Steps
- Encode these stages in CI with domain forks and common gates.
- Add environment matrix (linux/windows/mac) as needed by domain.

### Why this route + Confidence
- Aligns with master/common rules and supports multi-domain projects.
- Confidence: 0.84.
