# Project Rule: F7 QA (End-to-End)

## Inputs (In)
- FE/BE code + tests

## Outputs (Out)
- `reports/coverage-<slice>-<ts>.{json|md}`
- `reports/audit-qa-<ts>.md`
- `reports/validation-qa-<ts>.md`

## Protocol
1. Run test suites; collect coverage per slice.
2. Auditor summarizes QA findings; Validator issues GO/NOâ€‘GO.

## Acceptance
- Coverage meets thresholds; tests pass.
- Validation = GO; no Disagree items.

[STRICT]
- Coverage thresholds MUST be met or waivered with justification.
- Validation report MUST reference coverage artifacts by path.

[GUIDELINE]
- Track flaky tests and keep flakes < 2%.
