### Observability Plan (Metrics, Logs, Traces, SLO/SLA, Alerts)

- Goal(s): Define SLIs/SLOs and telemetry with actionable alerts.

### Assumptions
- Centralized tracing and metrics backend.

### Alternatives
- Logs-only; limited insight.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Alert fatigue (M×M): SLO-based alerts; runbooks.

### Dependencies
- Tracing SDK, metrics exporter, log pipeline.

### SLIs/SLOs
- Availability %, p95 latency, error rate, saturation
- Example SLO: API p95 < 300ms 99% of 28d

### Telemetry
- Correlation IDs; structured logs; trace percent sampling.

### Trigger → Rule → File(s)/Output mapping

| Trigger | Rules | Files/Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| observability | `F10-observability` | This plan | SLI dashboards exist |
| security | `F8-security` | Audit logs spec | PII-safe logging |

### Success Metrics
- 100% critical services with SLOs; MTTR < 30m.

### Next Steps
- Create dashboards and alert policies; attach runbooks.
