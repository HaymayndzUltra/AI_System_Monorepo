# Project Rule: F1 Discovery (End-to-End)

## Inputs (In)
- Stakeholder notes (optional), `docs/planning/prd.md` (draft)

## Outputs (Out)
- `docs/discovery/brief.md`
- `docs/discovery/rad.md`
- `reports/audit-discovery-<sessionId>-<ts>.md`
- `reports/validation-discovery-<sessionId>-<ts>.md`

## Protocol
1. Complete Brief and RAD with measurable KPIs and assigned mitigations.
2. Auditor generates audit report (scope, completeness, risks).
3. Validator issues GO/NO-GO with agreement matrix.

## Acceptance
- Brief and RAD present and complete.
- Validation = GO; no Disagree items.

[STRICT]
- The Auditor → Validator loop MUST complete with Decision=GO before transitioning to F2.
- KPIs in Brief MUST have baseline→target and measurement sources.

[GUIDELINE]
- Prefer concise, evidence-linked audits; avoid narrative without references.
