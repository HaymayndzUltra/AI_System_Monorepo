### Title
Testing Strategy with Audit/Validate Gates

### Goal(s)
- Define testing layers and connect them to audit/validation protocols.

### Why this route + Confidence
- Why: Ensures quality with explainable gates.
- Confidence: 0.82.

### Assumptions
1) Unit/integration/e2e tools vary by stack; contracts and audits are universal.

### Testing Layers
- Unit: fast, deterministic, isolated.
- Integration: service-to-service and data contracts.
- E2E: user-critical journeys.
- Non-functional: performance, accessibility, security scans.

### Trigger → Rule(s) → Outputs → Gates

| Trigger | Rule(s) | Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| test.unit | (future rule) | junit.xml | Advisory |
| test.integration | (future rule) | reports | Contracts pass |
| test.e2e | (future rule) | reports | E2E green |
| audit.run | `8-auditor-validator-protocol.mdc` | Audit report | Must pass |
| validation.run | `8-auditor-validator-protocol.mdc` | Validation report | Must pass |
| docs.sync | `5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines.mdc` | Updated test docs | Docs checks |

### Alternatives
- E2E-only testing: fragile; avoid.

### Risks and mitigations
- Flaky tests (Med × Med): Stabilize and parallelize; quarantine flakies.

### Dependencies
- CI configuration and resource quotas.

### Success Metrics
- Coverage trend positive; gate pass rates ≥95%.

### Next Steps
- Define per-project tools and thresholds; link to `observability-plan.md` for budgets.
