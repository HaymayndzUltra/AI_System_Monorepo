# Project Rule: Frontend End-to-End

## Inputs (In)
- `docs/planning/prd.md`, `PLAN.md`, `openapi/api-v1.0.yaml`

## Outputs (Out)
- `design/tokens/**`, `docs/design/*-spec.md`
- `src/frontend/**`, tests, READMEs
- `reports/audit-FE-<sessionId>-<ts>.md`, `reports/validation-FE-<sessionId>-<ts>.md`

## Protocol
1. Ensure phase prerequisites: F1/2/3/4 validations are GO for FE scope.
2. Implement FE per tasks (Focus Mode); maintain tests/docs.
3. Auditor → Validator per parent task/milestone; proceed only on GO.
4. Hand off to QA/Security/Release/Observability rules.

## Acceptance
- All FE tasks complete with passing tests; validations = GO; artifacts present.

[STRICT]
- FE implementation MUST NOT start until F3 tokens/specs and F4 contract are GO.
- Every parent task MUST pass Auditor→Validator before the next parent task.

[GUIDELINE]
- Keep FE changes token-driven and accessible by default.
