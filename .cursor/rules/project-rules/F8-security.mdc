# Project Rule: F8 Security (End-to-End)

## Inputs (In)
- Repo snapshot, dependency manifests

## Outputs (Out)
- `frameworks/security/findings.yaml`
- `frameworks/security/waivers.yaml`
- `frameworks/security/manifests/<cycle>/handoff_manifest.yaml`
- `frameworks/security/digests/<date>-digest.md`

## Protocol
1. Apply F8 overlay checks (secrets, deps, authz, privacy, audit).
2. Produce findings and manifests; Auditor/Validator on critical zero.

## Acceptance
- Critical = 0 (or waived with rationale); snapshot consistency OK.
