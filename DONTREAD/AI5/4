### Title
Security & Compliance Overlay Integration (F8 First-Class)

### Goals
- Make F8 overlay first-class in routing; always-on with scoped intensities.
- Provide explicit STRIDE-lite hooks and artifact outputs.

### Assumptions
- F8 is alwaysApply in master rules.

### Integration Points
- Pre-routing: add security.overlay capability by default.
- Risk-aware intensities: low/med/high adjust checklists (e.g., SCA required for med+).

### Threat Modeling Snippet (Template)
```markdown
[THREAT MODEL]
Assets: {assets}
Entry points: {endpoints}
Trust boundaries: {boundaries}
Mitigations: {bullets}
```

### Backward-Compat
- Old "security/compliance/audit" triggers map to security.overlay + security.audit.

### Trigger ↔ Rule(s) ↔ Files/Outputs
| Capability | Rule(s) | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| security.overlay | F8-security-and-compliance-overlay | Security checklist, STRIDE notes |
| security.audit | F8 + 8-auditor-validator-protocol | Audit report, validation plan |

### Risks
- Over-enforcement; allow policy exceptions with tracking.

### Dependencies
- Risk scorer (heuristic).
- SCA/DAST integration points.

### Success Metrics
- 0 plaintext secrets introduced.
- 100% high-risk tasks have audit artifacts.

### Next Steps
- Embed risk level detection.
- Add exception workflow and audit log.
