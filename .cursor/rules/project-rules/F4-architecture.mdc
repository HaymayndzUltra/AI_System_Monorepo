# Project Rule: F4 Architecture (End-to-End)

## Inputs (In)
- PRD/PLAN, Planning outputs

## Outputs (Out)
- `openapi/api-v1.0.yaml` (validated)
- `docs/architecture/adr-*.md` (if applicable)
- `reports/audit-arch-<sessionId>-<ts>.md`
- `reports/validation-arch-<sessionId>-<ts>.md`

## Protocol
1. Validate OpenAPI (CI gate) and record.
2. Capture ADRs for key decisions.
3. Auditor/Validator GO before implementation.

## Acceptance
- Contract validated; ADRs present for pivotal decisions.
- Validation = GO; no Disagree items.

[STRICT]
- OpenAPI validation MUST pass in CI before F6 starts.
- Breaking changes MUST bump `api-vX.Y` and trigger FE retargeting per plan.

[GUIDELINE]
- Co-locate ADRs with rationale and tradeoffs; link to audits.
