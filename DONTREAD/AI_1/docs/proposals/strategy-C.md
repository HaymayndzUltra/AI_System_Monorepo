### Title
Strategy C: Contract-First & Governance-by-Contract

### Goal(s)
- Define interfaces/schemas up front; generate stubs and enforce compatibility.

### Assumptions
1. Teams agree on contract sources of truth (OpenAPI/GraphQL schema/Protobuf/etc.).
2. Contract drift is unacceptable; breaking changes require formal review.

### Alternatives
- Code-first with retrofitted contracts. Rejected: drift risk.

### Risks and mitigations
- Overhead (M×M): Automate generation/linting; standardized templates.
- Hidden coupling (M×M): Consumer-driven contracts and backward compatibility policies.

### Dependencies
- Schema repos or directories; CI support for contract checks.

### Trigger → Rule → Outputs → Gates
| Capability | Rule(s) | Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| context.load | `.cursor/rules/master-rules/1-master-rule-context-discovery.mdc` | Contract inventory | — |
| security.overlay | `.cursor/rules/master-rules/F8-security-and-compliance-overlay.mdc` | SEC notes | Block criticals |
| docs.sync | `.cursor/rules/master-rules/5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines.mdc` | Versioned specs | Docs lint |
| validation.run | `.cursor/rules/master-rules/8-auditor-validator-protocol.mdc` | Validation report | Contract tests pass |

### Success Metrics
- Zero unreviewed breaking changes; ≥95% contract coverage; automated compatibility matrix.

### Next Steps
- Establish versioning policy; add breaking-change detectors; adopt CDC where applicable.

### Why this route + Confidence
- Reduces integration risk via early alignment.
- Confidence: 0.81.
