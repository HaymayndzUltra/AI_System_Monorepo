# Project Rule: F3 UX/UI (End-to-End)

## Inputs (In)
- PRD/PLAN

## Outputs (Out)
- `design/tokens/**`
- `docs/design/*-spec.md`
- `reports/audit-ux-<ts>.md`
- `reports/validation-ux-<ts>.md`

## Protocol
1. Define tokens with AA contrast; document component/page specs.
2. Set a11y/perf budgets; Auditor/Validator GO before FE build.

## Acceptance
- Tokens at AA; specs present; budgets defined.
- Validation = GO; no Disagree items.

[STRICT]
- Tokens MUST meet AA contrast and be referenced by FE build plan.
- A11y keyboard/ARIA checks MUST be specified prior to FE coding.

[GUIDELINE]
- Prefer token-driven theming; avoid hard-coded values.
