### Milestones, Estimates, Dependencies

- Goal(s): Phase delivery with dependencies and acceptance gates.

### Assumptions
- 2-week sprints; capacity known.

### Alternatives
- Big-bang delivery (risk).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Underestimation (M×M): Buffer; scope cuts.

### Dependencies
- Hiring, vendor tools, approvals.

### Milestones (example)
- M1: Discovery/PRD approved (2w)
- M2: Architecture & FE tokens (2w)
- M3: MVP backend + data schema (3w)
- M4: E2E + security hardening (2w)
- M5: Observability + release (1w)

### Acceptance Gates
- Each milestone must pass relevant capability gates.

### Trigger → Rule → File(s)/Output mapping

| Trigger | Rules | Files/Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| planning | `F2-planning` | This document | Capacity, risks present |
| release | `F9-release` | Release notes | Change control |

### Success Metrics
- On-time delivery ±10%; scope variance ≤15%.

### Next Steps
- Baseline estimates with team; finalize dependencies.
