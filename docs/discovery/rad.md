## Delta Requests

### 🔴 Security Blocking Issues
1. **Automated Verification Scope Reduction**
   - **Current**: 80% reduction in manual reviews
   - **Requested**: 60% reduction to allow for human oversight on high-risk cases
   - **Rationale**: Security team requires manual review for PII-heavy documents and international users
   - **Impact**: May affect timeline by 1 week, completion rate goal reduced to 85%

2. **Additional Security Controls**
   - **Request**: Implement document tampering detection
   - **Request**: Add biometric verification fallback for high-risk users
   - **Timeline Impact**: +2 days development

### 🟡 Engineering Concerns
1. **Timeline Extension Request**
   - **Current**: 8 weeks development + 2 weeks testing
   - **Requested**: 10 weeks development + 2 weeks testing
   - **Rationale**: Complex integration with legacy authentication system
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel development streams for UI and backend

2. **Technology Stack Clarification**
   - **Request**: Confirm Node.js version compatibility (current: v16, target: v18)
   - **Request**: Database migration strategy for user verification tables

### 🟢 Product/Design Alignment
- All product and design requirements validated
- UI mockups approved by all stakeholders
- User journey mapping completed and signed off

## Decision

### ✅ APPROVED with Modifications

**Decision Date**: [Current Date]  
**Decision Maker**: Product Engineering Review Board  
**Approval Status**: ✅ Conditional Approval  

#### Approved Changes

4. Update stakeholder communications with revised goals

**Effective Date**: Immediate  
**Review Date**: End of Week 2 (progress checkpoint)

## Blocking (if any)

### 🚫 No Active Blockers
All identified concerns have been addressed through the approved modifications. The project can proceed with the adjusted scope and timeline.

### ⚠️ Monitoring Items (Non-Blocking)
1. **Security Review Completion**: Track completion of security architecture review by Week 2
2. **Integration Complexity**: Monitor legacy system integration challenges during development
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track actual onboarding time improvements against baseline

### 📊 Risk Mitigation Status
- **High Risk**: Legacy authentication integration → Mitigation: Parallel development streams
- **Medium Risk**: Automated verification accuracy → Mitigation: Human oversight for high-risk cases
- **Low Risk**: Technology stack updates → Mitigation: Comprehensive testing plan
