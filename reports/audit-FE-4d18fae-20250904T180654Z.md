# Frontend Audit @ HEAD

- Commit: 4d18fae
- Scope: Frontend
- Date: 2025-09-04T18:06:54Z

## Presence Check
- src/frontend: MISSING
- design/tokens: MISSING
- docs/design: MISSING

## Task Alignment (tasks-frontend.md)
- Exists: YES
- All items: PENDING (no frontend implementation present)

## Build/Config
- No frontend build configs found (Vite/Next/Webpack).

## Findings & Actions
- Scaffold frontend per tasks (`src/frontend/app/**`), add routing and tests.
- Integrate design tokens under `design/tokens/**` and add design docs in `docs/design/`.
- Set up build tooling (e.g., Vite) and basic CI checks for lint/test/build.
