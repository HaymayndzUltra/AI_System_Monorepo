### Title
Observability-Driven Release Gates

### Goals
- Gate releases on SLOs and audit/validation artifacts.
- Provide canary and rollback policies tied to telemetry.

### Assumptions
- Access to build metadata (commit SHA) and basic telemetry.

### Capabilities
- release.prepare, release.deploy, observe.metrics, observe.traces, observe.logs

### Gate Logic (Pseudocode)
```pseudo
if !audit.validation.GO: block
if error_budget_burn > threshold: block
if coverage < min: warn/block per policy
if canary_fail_rate > threshold: auto-rollback
```

### Backward-Compat
- "release, deploy" map to release.* + observe.*

### Trigger ↔ Rule(s) ↔ Files/Outputs
| Capability | Rule(s) | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| release.prepare | dev-workflow + F8 | release notes, changelog |
| release.deploy | F8 + release policy | rollout plan, canary config |
| observe.* | observability rules (future) | dashboards refs, SLO doc |

### Risks
- Telemetry gaps; provide manual override with sign-off.

### Dependencies
- CI integration for metrics; change log generator.

### Success Metrics
- <1% rollback after GA.
- 100% releases have audit + validation artifacts.

### Next Steps
- Define SLO schema + thresholds.
- Implement canary/rollback policy templates.
