### Security Plan (Threat Model, SAST/DAST/SBOM, Evidence)

- Goal(s): Apply F8 overlay across lifecycle; prove with CI evidence.

### Assumptions
- Centralized secret manager; CI attestation supported.

### Alternatives
- Scan only on main (late detection).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Secret sprawl (M×H): Scoped secrets, rotation, detection.
- Supply-chain (M×H): SBOM + signed artifacts; dependency pinning.

### Dependencies
- SAST/DAST tools, secret manager, KMS, audit logging.

### Threat Model (STRIDE-lite)
- Assets: code, pipelines, runtime, data
- Entry: PRs, APIs, CI runners
- Mitigations: authN/Z, input validation, WAF, rate limits, encryption

### Evidence in CI
- SAST, DAST, SBOM, dependency audit; artifact attestations.

### Trigger → Rule → File(s)/Output mapping

| Trigger | Rules | Files/Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| security, audit | `F8-security-and-compliance-overlay`, `project-rules/F8-security` | This plan | Block on criticals; signed build |
| enterprise, RBAC | `common-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated` | RBAC map | Audit trail configured |

### Success Metrics
- 0 critical vulns in main; full secret scans clean.

### Next Steps
- Enable scanners; configure policy thresholds and KMS policies.
