### Title
Frontend UX Plan aligned to UI Foundation and Interaction Rules

### Goal(s)
- Deliver professional UX with design tokens, accessibility, and performance budgets.

### Why this route + Confidence
- Why: The common UI rules provide AA accessibility and interaction/performance standards applicable across stacks.
- Confidence: 0.85.

### Assumptions
1) `ui.foundation` and `ui.interaction` capabilities are in scope.
2) Premium features are gated (optional).

### Plan
- Generate tokens and grids per `common-rule-ui-foundation-design-system.mdc`.
- Define interaction patterns per `common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc`.
- For premium experiences, consult `common-rule-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated.mdc`.

### Trigger → Rule(s) → Outputs → Gates

| Trigger | Rule(s) | Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| tokens, AA, grid | `common-rule-ui-foundation-design-system.mdc` | Tokens, grids | AA contrast |
| aria, keyboard, perf | `common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc` | Interaction specs | INP/LCP budgets |
| premium | `common-rule-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated.mdc` | Premium spec | Guardrails |

### Alternatives
- Ad-hoc component styles: risks inconsistency; avoid.

### Risks and mitigations
- Token drift (Med × Med): Centralize tokens; automate checks.

### Dependencies
- Common UI rules; dev-workflow for implementation.

### Success Metrics
- AA compliance ≥ 95%; INP ≤ 200ms P75 on key flows.

### Next Steps
- Produce token files and component specs; link to `observability-plan.md` for budgets.
