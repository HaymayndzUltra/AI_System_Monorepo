# Project Rule: F9 Release (End-to-End)

## Inputs (In)
- Validated code and artifacts

## Outputs (Out)
- `reports/release-notes-<ver>.md`
- `deploy/**` manifests
- `reports/validation-release-<ts>.md`

## Protocol
1. Generate notes; verify versioning and changelogs.
2. Validator GO before production; rollback plan verified.

## Acceptance
- Notes, manifests, and validation present; rollback ready.

[STRICT]
- Production deploy MUST be blocked without Validator GO and rollback plan.
- Release notes MUST list breaking changes and dependency risks.

[GUIDELINE]
- Prefer progressive delivery (blue/green or canary) with quick rollback.
