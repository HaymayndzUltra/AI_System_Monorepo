# Trigger System Plan (2.1–2.3)

Commit: 864d930

## 2.1 Trigger Architecture
- Validation engine with pluggable rules
- State machine with transition validation
- Registry with metadata & schemas
- Execution engine with error handling & rollback
- Audit logging

## 2.2 Artifact Validation System
- Schema validation for docs (brief, rad, prd, tasks)
- Frontmatter validation (runId, version, status, timestamps)
- Dependency checks (required artifacts exist)
- Content checks (completeness, quality)
- Immutability enforcement for approved docs

## 2.3 Phase Transition Logic
- Entry/exit criteria per phase
- Approval gates (Auditor → Validator)
- Rollback with state preservation
- Notifications & analytics
