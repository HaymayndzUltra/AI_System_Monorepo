### Title
Strategy C: Agile-First with Guardrails

### Goal(s)
- Maximize velocity while retaining essential safety nets.

### Assumptions
- Teams have strong test culture and observability.
- Risk tolerance is higher; fast iteration is prioritized.

### Approach
- Mandatory: Context Discovery, AI Collaboration, Security F8 on sensitive changes.
- Mod-Safety used for high-risk edits only; otherwise lightweight change plans.
- Audit/Validate post-merge sampling with tight rollback capability.

### Alternatives
- Strategy A/B.

### Risks and Mitigations
- Increased regression risk (M×M): feature flags, canary, fast rollback.
- Quality dips (M×M): enforce unit test coverage floors and alerting.

### Dependencies
- Feature flag system, automated rollback, solid CI observability.

| Trigger | Rule(s) | Files/Outputs | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|

### Success Metrics
- ≥30% faster iteration vs Strategy A with ≤5% rollback rate.

### Next Steps
- Define fast-lane criteria and post-merge audit cadence.

### Why this route + Confidence
Signals: emphasis on velocity with guardrails. Confidence: 0.79.
