### QA + Observability Orchestrator (QO1)

- **Goals**
  - Auto-attach QA (F7) and Observability (F10) to relevant intents.
  - Enforce test strategy + telemetry/SLOs early.

- **Assumptions**
  - CI present with coverage reports.
  - Logging/tracing libraries available.

- **Alternatives**
  - Handle via Dev-Workflow only (less granular).

- **Risks**
  - Noise from over-eager checklists; mitigate by capability/domain scoping.

- **Dependencies**
  - Coverage tools; tracing infra.

### Routing Logic
- If intent includes qa/test/coverage → F7.
- If intent includes observability/metrics/tracing/retro → F10.
- On Code.Modify with >N files or critical paths → attach F7 + F10 automatically.

### Trigger ↔ Rule(s) ↔ Files/Outputs
| Condition | Rules | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| qa, test strategy | F7 | Test plan, coverage thresholds |
| observability | F10 | Telemetry plan, SLOs, dashboards |
| complex refactor | 4 + 6 + F7 | Impact analysis + non-regression plan |

### Example Messages → Resolution
- "Create test plan for payments" → F7.
- "Add request tracing and SLOs" → F10.

### Migration Plan
- Mirror-on in modify+release flows.
- Require QA/Obs sections in proposals/PR templates.

### Success Metrics
- Coverage meets thresholds per module.
- SLOs defined and tracked for all critical services.
- Flake rate < 2%; alert noise reduced QoQ.

### Next Steps
- Add PR template checks.
- Hook CI to block on missing QA/Obs artifacts.
