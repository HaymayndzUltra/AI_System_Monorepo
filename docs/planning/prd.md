# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem
Develop an AI-Governed Development Framework that enforces phase gates, audits, and validations for FE/BE slices with contract-first flows.

## Target Users
- Developers (FE/BE) needing clear tasks and gates
- Tech Leads seeking governance and traceability
- QA/Security reviewers requiring evidence

## KPIs
- OpenAPI validation pass rate: 100%
- Audit artifacts completeness per parent task: 100%
- Critical security vulnerabilities: 0 (moderate → 0 as follow-up)
- Test coverage (initial): ≥70% per slice

## Constraints
- Contract pinned: openapi/api-v1.0.yaml for FE
- CI must block on failed audits/validations
- No plaintext secrets in code/config

## Acceptance Criteria
- Phase outputs and decision reports exist per rules
- Auditor→Validator GO before proceeding per parent task/phase
- CI green on governance gates
